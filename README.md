 Lane Detection and Traffic Sign Detection for Autonomous Vehicles using CARLA     
Over the last ten years, several attempts have been undertaken to improve algorithmic
performance and provide datasets for semantic segmentation. Recently, substantial
progress has been made in this topic, which is a subset of visual scene interpretation,
owing to the contribution of deep learning approaches. Here, some of the most
extensively used and open urban semantic segmentation datasets for self-driving car
applications are explored and identified.
